# GITHUB Training

## Concepts

### Repository

History of changes in a control version stored in a server, in this case in Github.

## Markdown

Markdown is a very verstile formating specification for documentation.

You can add blocks like this.

> This is a block of text
> That continues in a second line
> and finishes in this third line.

Another thing you can do is bullets

* First
* Second
* Third

+ First
    + Subfirst
    + Subsecond
    + Subthird
+ Second
    - Subfirst
    - Subsecond
    - Subthird
+ Third

Now I want to add some code
```js
function helloWorld() {
  console.log("Hello Workd")
  }
```
